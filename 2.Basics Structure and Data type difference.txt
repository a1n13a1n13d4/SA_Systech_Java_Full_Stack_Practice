First we want to create the Project, then Packages, Class.
The Structure is,
package packagename;

public class classname{  
     public static void main(String[] args) {
     //any programs runned here only
     }
}

Compare to Normal other program java differ in declaration two place.
Normally we declare int, char. But, we declare float with addition of f in last.
Example, 
       float x=80.5f;
Then String declaration differ in String(First letter Caps).
Example,
       String x="My Name";
